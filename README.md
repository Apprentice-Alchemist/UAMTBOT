# UAMTBOT

To start this app locally, you need a couple things:
- a valid token (sorry, not gonna give you mine for now :)
- node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or use yum on Linux)

After installing the node.js and downloading the code and setting auth.json with the token (see below), do:
- npm install discord.js

To run the bot, just type
- node bot.js

Auth token file should look like this:

{
    "token": "MySuP3RS3cR37T0kEn"
}
